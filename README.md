# Walt Disney World Wait Time Guide

This application is created using analysis of 3 variables to assess the best conditions to find the shortest wait times when visiting the Magic Kingdom. Users may select the month, time of day, and attraction of the ride to view how long the ride they hope to ride is likely to be. Custom tableau visualizations are also inserted into the application so that users can see how to minimize their wait-times.
